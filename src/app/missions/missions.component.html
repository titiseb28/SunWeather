                    The first satellites designed to observe the Sun were NASA's Pioneers 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between
                    1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of Earth, and made the first detailed
                    measurements
                    of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data
                    until May 1983.

                    In the 1970s, two Helios spacecraft and the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount provided scientists with significant new
                    data on solar
                    wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.–German collaborations that studied the solar wind
                    from an orbit
                    carrying the spacecraft inside Mercury's orbit at perihelion. The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973,
                    included a
                    solar observatory module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the
                    station.Skylab made
                    the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar
                    corona. Discoveries
                    included the first observations of coronal mass ejections, then called "coronal transients", and of coronal holes,
                    now known to be
                    intimately associated with the solar wind.

                    One of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,
                    jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission,
                    a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009.It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics
                    Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational
                    pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.Besides its direct solar observation,
                    SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.

                    All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail.
                    The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to Jupiter, to "slingshot" into an orbit that
                    would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic
                    field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than
                    expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.

                    Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from spectroscopic studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more
                    poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.

                    The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission was launched in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause
                    them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind Earth. This enables stereoscopic imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as coronal
                    mass ejections.

                    The Indian Space Research Organisation has scheduled the launch of a 100 kg satellite named Aditya for 2017–18. Its main instrument will be a coronagraph
                    for studying the dynamics of the Solar corona.

                            Parker Solar Probe will be an extraordinary and historic mission, exploring what is arguably the last region of the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft,
                            the Sun’s outer atmosphere or corona as it extends out into space. Approaching as close as 9.5 solar radii* (8.5 solar radii above the Sun’s surface), Parker Solar
                            Probe will repeatedly sample the near-Sun environment, revolutionizing our knowledge and understanding of coronal heating and of the origin and evolution of the
                            solar wind and answering critical questions in heliophysics that have been ranked as top priorities for decades. Moreover, by making direct, in-situ measurements
                            of the region where some of the most hazardous solar energetic particles are energized, Parker Solar Probe will make a fundamental contribution to our ability to
                            characterize and forecast the radiation environment in which future space explorers will work and live.

                            Solar Orbiter is a joint ESA-NASA collaboration that will address the central question of heliophysics: 
                            How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere? This primary, overarching scientific objective can be broken down into four interrelated scientific questions:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            How and where do the solar wind plasma and magnetic field originate in the corona?
                            How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability?
                            How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?
                            How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?
                            These are outstanding fundamental questions in solar and heliophysics today. By addressing them, Solar Orbiter will make major breakthroughs in our understanding of how the
                            inner solar system works and is driven by solar activity.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To answer these questions, it is essential to make in-situ measurements of the solar wind plasma, fields, waves, and energetic particles close enough to the Sun that
                            they are still relatively pristine and have not had their properties modified by subsequent transport and propagation processes. This is one of the fundamental drivers
                            for the Solar Orbiter mission, which will approach the Sun to 0.28 AU.
                        </p>


                        <img src="https://lws.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/solar_orbiter_mission.jpg" class="float-left img-fluid col-12 col-md-auto" />

                        <p>
                            Solar Orbiter is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft equipped with instruments for both in-situ measurements and remote-sensing observations. It will be placed into an
                            elliptical orbit about the Sun with perihelion as close as 0.28 AU. After an in-ecliptic phase of perihelion passes where it is nearly corotating with the Sun, Solar
                            Orbiter will use multiple Venus gravity assist maneuvers to move the inclination of its orbit to progressively higher heliolatitudes, reaching ∼34° by the end of its
                            extended mission.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            NASA is contributing two instruments to the collaboration, as well as an expendable launch vehicle. The two U.S. contributions are SoloHI, a wide-field heliospheric
                            imager provided by the Naval Research Laboratory; and a Heavy Ion Sensor (part of the Solar Wind Analyzer) provided by Southwest Research Institute. ESA is providing
                            the spacecraft, built by Astrium, U.K.; and European nations are providing the remainder of the ten instrument payload. The launch date from Kennedy Space Center is
                            currently scheduled for 2017.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Relating these in-situ measurements back to their source regions and structures on the Sun requires simultaneous, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations
                            of the Sun in and out of the ecliptic plane. The resulting combination of in-situ and remote-sensing instruments on the same spacecraft, together with the new, inner-heliospheric
                            perspective, distinguishes Solar Orbiter from all previous and current missions, enabling breakthrough science which can be achieved in no other way.
